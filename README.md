# Right-click-menu-paste
Addon created to speed up job forum applications. 
(And also to let me practice coding)

This addon allows the user to input text on the extention's options (Address, Email, ect) and paste that text directly on input fields using the right click menu. It will use the copy-paste clipboard directly, bypassing application forums that do not allow auto-fill.

Minimum Viable Product complete. 
Missing features: Dynamically changing context menu, ability to add/remove row.

# Installation

1) Download and unzip the repository into any location on your local machine. 
2) Navigate to chrome://extensions on your chrome browser. (Alternatively, open chrome option -> More Tools -> Extensions) 
3) Select the "Developer mode" checkmark on the top right hand of the page. 
4) Select the "Load unpacked extension" button
5) Select the unzipped folder where you stored this repo. 

# User's Guide

Clicking on the popup menu button will open the extention's homepage.

Three rows are currently hardcoded into the MVP version of this extention. 
On each row, the first text box is linked to your context menu.
The second text box is the value that will be pasted on selecting the option.
